    "Some say golf is a game of luck. While this may be true for the weekend player hacking it around his local municipal course, the players on the PGA Tour are a different beast. They bomb drives down the fairway with pinpoint accuracy and have beautiful short games to match. The question remians though: What makes a player have a great season? In this tutorial, I will answer that question as I analyze player rankings in a few key categories to determine which of these categories matter most."

    "This is the first stage of the data lifecycle. This stage consists of gathering data from whatever source best suits your data science project. Some of these sources are websites, publicly available datasets, and APIs (more on these later). This information normally comes in a few standards forms (we will only talk about three of these forms):  \n",
    "&emsp;**1. CSV Files:** CSV stands for comma separated values and it is exactly what is sounds like. The data will come in a format where each attribute (column) is separated by a comma and each observation (row) is separated by a newline. For more information, folow this link, https://www.howtogeek.com/348960/what-is-a-csv-file-and-how-do-i-open-it/  \n",
    "&emsp;**2. JSON Files:** JSON is another standard data format where there are two basic data types you will have to deal with (not including strings, integers, booleans, and null). These two formats are an object, called a JSON object, and an array. A JSON object is a key-value pair where the key is a some string representing a defining characteristic for whatever the value is. An array, on the other hand, functions as a container for a user to store certain values that are related in some way. For example, if a teacher were to store their student's names in a JSON object, it may look like this, {\"students\":[\"John\",\"Suzy\",...]}, where the ... is the rest of array containing the other names. For more information on JSON, follow this link, https://www.copterlabs.com/json-what-it-is-how-it-works-how-to-use-it/  \n",
    "&emsp;**3. HTML (this tutorial):** Many times, the data we gather may need to be extracted from an HTML table on a webpage. The structure this data is presented in is not always as uniform as the prior few forms, but HTML parsing libraries such as BeautifulSoup make the process hassle-free."

    "&emsp;2.BeautifulSoup: Used to parse the html retrieved by the GET request  \n",
    "&emsp;3.Pandas: Used to create data sturctures to organize data for ease of analysis  \n",
    "&emsp;4.Pickle(optional): Used to store data structure in an external file for quicker subsequent retrievals (multiple get requests take up time). As mentioned above, CSV would be another valid format to store the data in, but since my data will be split up into about 17 different DataFrames all stored in a dictionary, it will be easier to store it all in one pickle file. Int he case of a single DataFrame, CSV should definitely be one of a user's first instincts for faster retrieval."

    "Now comes the second step of the data science pipeline, Data Processing. We did a little bit of this step in our Data Collection step. This step involves taking the data you collected and put into a DataFrame, and cleaning it up for future analysis. This can include tidying up data (each attribute in a column, and each observation in a row), dealing with columns or entries which contain missing data, and melting data. In our last step we put the data into the dataframe, but there is one major problem. Our data is very wide and spread out as it is stored in 17 different DataFrames. It gives us a lot of information, but way more than we will actually need. We will condense all 17 DataFrames into 1 DataFrame. Below I have the code that does this, and will explain what I did after."
